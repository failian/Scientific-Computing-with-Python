# Scientific Computing with Python Prjects
### freecodecamp

These are my solutions to the five code challenges in freecodecamp's scientific computing with python projects that can
be found here: 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/#scientific-computing-with-python-projects

The challenges are:
* [Arithmetic Formatter/README.md](Arithmetic Formatter)
* [Budget App/README.md](Budget App)
* [Polygon Area Calculator/README.md](Polygon Area Calculator)
* [Probability Calculator/README.md](Probability Calculator)
* [Time Calculator/README.md](Time Calculator)

My solutions can be found in:
* [arithmetic_arranger.py](Arithmetic Formatter/arithmetic_arranger.py)
* [budget.py](Budget App/budget.py)
* [shape_calculator.py](Polygon Area Calculator/shape_calculator.py)
* [prob_calculator.py](Probability Calculator/prob_calculator.py)
* [time_calculator.py](Time Calculator/time_calculator.py)
